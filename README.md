browser-proxy is software that is designed to run on a server for the purpose of accessing sites which are blocked.

It is designed to modify pages so that all the resources are redirected through the proxy server rather than their original locations, to ensure that none of it is blocked.

This, of course, relies on the proxy server itself not being blocked.

*This software was tested using PHP 7.0 on Apache for Windows, using other versions may have unintended sideffects.*
